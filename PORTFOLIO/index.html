                <h2>About Me</h2>
                 <p1>I've been studying at Nackademin with the goal of becoming a technical 3D artist. I've played games my
                whole life and my dream is to one day work for a gaming company. I have experience with programs like
                Maya 3D, ZBrush, Substance 3D Painter, Houdini, Unreal Engine and Photoshop. I've learned a lot about 3D
                modeling, sculpting, texturing, animation, rigging and Python scripting. I'm mostly interested in
                Character Art and any object design — everything from trees to buildings and more.</p1>

                <h3>Tyrande Whisperwind</h3>
            <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                
                <p4>Tyrande Whisperwind is a character from the game World of Warcraft by Blizzard Entertainment. I
                    learned how to use the Unreal Engine skeleton on a custom character to import it easily into the
                    engine and play the character. I also explored cloth animation using Chaos Cloth. Tools used: Maya,
                    ZBrush, Substance 3D Painter, Unreal Engine.</p4>

                <h3>Fantasy Tree</h3>
            <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                
                <p4>This was one of my first projects — a mystical tree with roots growing around columns. I was new to
                    the software and learned a lot in every program. I used Maya's curve tool to build the tree base,
                    ZBrush for sculpting twisted bark, and Substance 3D Painter for texturing techniques.</p4>

                <h3>Car Engine</h3>
            <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                
                <p4>This project focused on texturing car parts under a car hood. The models were pre-made, but the
                    focus was on texturing. I became more confident in using Substance 3D Painter.</p4>

                <h3>Meet Mat</h3>
            <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                
                <p4>This was a quick texturing project using the built-in Meet Mat mesh in Substance 3D Painter. It was
                    a small but fun project to show more texture work. I rendered the final result in Maya.</p4>
