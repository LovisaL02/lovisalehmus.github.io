                <h2>About Me</h2>
                 <p1>I've been studying at Nackademin with the goal of becoming a technical 3D artist. I've played games my
                whole life and my dream is to one day work for a gaming company. I have experience with programs like
                <strong>Maya 3D</strong>, <strong>ZBrush</strong>, <strong>Substance 3D Painter</strong>, <strong>Houdini</strong>, <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong>. I've learned a lot about 3D
                modeling, sculpting, texturing, animation, rigging and Python scripting. I'm mostly interested in
                Character Art and any object design — everything from trees to buildings and more.</p1>

                <h3>Tyrande Whisperwind</h3>
            <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                
                <p4>Tyrande Whisperwind is a character from the game World of Warcraft by Blizzard Entertainment. I
                    learned how to use the Unreal Engine skeleton on a custom character to import it easily into the
                    engine and play the character. I also explored cloth animation using Chaos Cloth. It was also my first time doing retopology on the body to make it more "animation-friendly", but unfortunately I didn't have time to do face rigging because of the short
                    amount of time we had.<br />
                    I used a pre-made level called <a class="dream"href="https://www.fab.com/listings/c4e83f22-369a-4f5c-8f86-d53ccd716ae6" target="_blank">Dreamscape</a> made by PolyArt Studio.<br />
                    <br />
                    I really enjoyed sculpting the face in Zbrush. I used to love drawing different faces when I was young, sculpting faces in 3D makes it even more fun.<br />
                    In the future I will continue on this character and make a face rig.<br />
                    Tools used: Maya, ZBrush, Substance 3D Painter, Unreal Engine.</p4>

                <h3>Fantasy Tree</h3>
            <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                
                <p4>This was one of my first projects — a mystical tree with roots growing around columns. I was new to
                    the software and learned a lot in every program. I used Maya's curve tool to build the tree base and branches, aswell as the leafs,
                    ZBrush for sculpting the twisted bark and the leafs, and Substance 3D Painter for the texturing.<br />
                    The building was only made in Maya and Substance 3D Painter, so no sculpting was made on it.

                <h3>Iceland — Group Project</h3>
                <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                    <p4>
                        This group project was made by three people, including me. The project was made with Maya, Zbrush, Substance 3D Painter, Unreal Engine and GitHub.<br /> 
                        I made the house called "torvhus", with some help with making the walls, since we didn't have alot of time so we had to cooperate a lot. 
                        I also made a viking axe. We used GitHub to push our changes we did to the Unreal Engine project. 
                    </p4>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p4>
                        Our task was to show Iceland what it might have been like in the past with the help of an artist who was quite famous in Iceland
                         (I won't mention his name due to privacy reasons). As the window opens, we see it slowly shifts to the future. Buildings in the background start to emerge. 
                         The cart next to the house (that you see before the window opens) turns into the van that this artist and his band used to transport themselves.

            <div class="project" id="breadtxt">
                
                <p4>During the texturing course, we learned more about Substance 3D Painter. The task was to texture car parts under a car hood. The car model was pre-made, because the
                    focus was on texturing. I became more confident in using Substance 3D Painter. Picture rendered in Maya</p4>

                <p4>This was a quick texturing project using the built-in Meet Mat mesh in Substance 3D Painter. It was
                    a small but fun project to show more texture work. I rendered the final result in Maya.</p4>
